The Excel Bike Sales Dashboard project involves creating a dashboard that summarizes bike sales data for a specific period. 
The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of key metrics, including total sales, total quantity sold, and average price per bike model. 
The data is presented in various formats, including charts, tables, and graphs. The dashboard also includes filters that allow users to analyze the data by marital status, region, education, etc.  
This project aims to provide insights into bike sales trends and help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
This project requires proficiency in Excel, including data manipulation, PivotTables, charts, and other Excel features.
